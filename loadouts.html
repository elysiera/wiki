<p>Elysiera has a <i>unique</i> way to refill your hunts, or even completely swap supply loads with <strong>loadouts</strong>. When you type <code>!loadout</code> in game you'll see this:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/loadouts_usage.png"></figure>
<p><strong>Loadouts </strong>can be created by editing one <code>!loadout edit energy</code> or <code>!loadout edit bosses</code>, the <strong>loadout</strong> name can be <i>anything</i>! If you ever forget a command don't forget you can always hit <code>!loadout</code> to see example usage.</p>
<h2>Configuring Loadouts</h2>
<p>When doing <code>!loadout edit</code> you'll have the opportunity to configure your loadout.</p>
<figure class="table" style="height:500px;">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-left" style="width:79.18%;"><img src="/loadout_edit.png"></figure>
        </td>
        <td>
          <figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/loadout_confirmed.png">
            <figcaption>Loadout confirmation</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<p>Note that only items that are sold by <strong>Battlemart </strong>and <strong>Stashable </strong>(meaning can be stored in your stash) are available for loadouts. You have to use the full name of the item (no abbreviations).</p>
<p>Any lines prefixed with a <code>+</code> will add items to your loadout, followed by the item name and then a number of items to acquire. If you have more than that number, the rest will be stashed when accepting the loadout from <strong>Battlemart</strong>.</p>
<p>Any lines prefixed with a <code>-</code> will <i>remove </i>items. Meaning these items will be <i>stashed</i> when filling a loadout from <strong>Battlemart</strong>, all of them.</p>
<p>The system will tell which lines are invalid when you submit a loadout, so you can try some things out to get the hang of it.</p>
<h2>Filling Loadouts</h2>
<p>Once you have loadouts setup (you can see them via <code>!loadout list</code>). You can ask <strong>Battlemart</strong> to fill them for you. This process is really simple. When you greet them, they will offer you to <strong>trade</strong> or to fill a <strong>loadout</strong>. Click <strong>loadout</strong> (or simply say <code>loadout</code>) and <strong>Battlemart</strong> will list all of your available loadout configurations. Once you select one this will happen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All <i>undesired items<strong> </strong></i>(items configured with a <code>-</code> ) will be sent you your <i>Stash</i>.</li>
  <li>For each desired item, <strong>Battlemart</strong> will pull from your <i>Stash</i> into your inventory, free of charge to you. If this is enough to fill your order, you're done!</li>
  <li>Now, <strong>Battlemart</strong> will gladly sell you all the remaining items you need, and once that's done, assuming you have enough money and capacity, you're ready for battle!</li>
</ul>
