# Knight

Knights are the only vocation that actively mange both health and mana potions. Due to their shared cooldown, this often leads to situations where the choice is to only drink health potions to survive, while being unable to recover mana to break free from a surround. Additionally, knights have suffered a disproportionate impact from mana drain mechanics. This rework completely removes mana drain's effects on a knight's resource. Finally, knights' single-target spell options have felt underwhelming. 

We are reworking the knight's resource system and redesigning all knight abilities to work within. By refining the resource system, knights can now simultaneously manage health and combat resource independently, offering a smoother and more controlled battle rhythm. This change is also impactful in the early game, allowing for a progression system that feels just as viable as other vocations. To address knight's single target rotations, certain spells have been redefined with a clear strategic purpose, providing a niche to many of the underutilized abilities. These adjustments are designed to elevate the knights' playstyle, providing a richer and more robust combat experience.

# :new: New Resource: Rage
- **Maximum Rage**: 1000 points
- **Rage Mechanics**: Replaces mana. Increases with designated combat actions; passively decays or regenerates towards a baseline of 200.
- **Developer Notes**: We aim to create a more dynamic combat system, where resource management becomes crucial to your success on the battlefield.
