# Skill and Item changes

Elysiera introduces a number of changes to many items, and spells.

## Item Changes
- All arrows deal damage in a 5x5 area of effect.
- - Basic arrows are infinite
- Bolts remain single target
- - Basic bolts are infinite
- Wands and Rods now have their own attack values, scale with Magic Level and Chain to multiple enemies (4 base)
- All spears and throwing weapons chain to up to 5 enemes.

**Runes revamped**
- AOE runes (Great Fireball, etc) damage increased by **26%**
**Single Target rune revamp:**
- Fireball now chains to up to 5 targets. Deals **10%** less damage than Sudden Death.
- Stalagmite now chains to up to 5 targets. Deals **10%** less damage than Sudden Death.
- Icicle now chains to up to 5 targets. Deals **10%** less damage than Sudden Death.
- Heavy Magic Missile now chains to up to 5 targets. Deals **10%** less damage than Sudden Death.
***Developer notes:** We wanted to give outdated runes a situational use. The Sudden Death rune has been the goto rune for single target. Certain monster resistances or vulnerabilities will give the player the option to optimize damage with elemental runes.*

## Paladin skill changes
**Divine Dazzle:**

-   Chain effect on up to 5 creatures (base)
-   Works on melee creatures (if they can run on low health)
-   Prevents creatures from running on low health
-   Skips already affected creatures

**Protect Party:**

-   Decreases party members damage take by 1%

**Divine Missile**

-   Chain effect on up to 5 creatures
-   ***Developer notes:** Divine Missile and Ethereal Spear are nearly identical. We wanted to define a situational usage for one spell over the other.*

**Sharpshooter**
- Now grants 1 charge instead of boosting damage. Charge will allow you to change the effect of one of the following skills:
- *Ethereal Spear*: Fires 5 times for -25% damage per shot.
- *Strong Ethereal Spear*: Deals +10% damage and changes its element to the targets lowest element
- *Divine Missile*: +20% damage and Chains to 3 additional targets.
- *Divine Caldera*: Increases damage by 10% and casts twice. Second cast costs no mana.

*Rank 2 of Augmented Sharpshooter Wheel of Destiny convication gives 2 charges instead of 1*

**New spell: Conjure Royal Star**
- Creates 30 Royal Stars for 1,000 mana
- Requires level 150

**New spell: Conjure Spectral Bolts**
- Creates 100 Spectral Bolts for 1,000 mana
- Requires level 150

**New spell: Conjure Diamond Arrows**
- Creates 100 Diamond Arrows for 1,000 mana
- Requires level 150

## Knight skill changes
**Chivalrous Challenge:**

-   Chain effect on up to 6 creatures (base)
-   Skips already affected creatures

**Challenge:**

-   Changes ranged creatures to melee (except for bosses)

**Train Party:**

-   Increases party skills by 2% (primary skill; i.e. magic for mages, distance for paladins, does not affect other knights) (does not stack with other knights)

## Sorcerer skill changes

## Druid skill changes

**Heal Party:**

-   30 health per second (instead of 20 every 2)

## Sorcerer & Druid changes
**Magic Shield**
Magic Shield (utamo vita) now completely absorbs 40% of all damage taken. It costs no mana upon taking damage.
utamo vita gives you a shield of 300 + 7.6 x level + 7 x magic-level. The mana cost to cast the spell is 50% of the amount of shield it provides.
Example: If you're level 500 with magic level 100 you'll get 4800 magic shield points (purple bar). Casting utamo vita will cost 2400 mana.
When you take damage, 40% will go to that shield instead, the other 60% will go to your health
Magic shield nodes on wheel of destiny also affect this shield

**Strong & Ultimate Strike spells have been overhauled.**
- Strong Strikes all share the same cooldown
- Strong Strikes cooldown reduced to 6 seconds
- Strong Strikes deal 60% of Sudden Death damage
- Ultimate Strikes deal 80% of Sudden Death damage

**Strong Strikes now give a stacking buff called Elemental Charge.**
- Capped at 3
- Stack lasts for 10 seconds (Stacks refresh when casting Strong Strikes)

Casting the next Ultimate Strike while having stacks of Elemental Charge will multiply the damage by 1+stacks (4x at max stacks)
