# Skill and Item changes

Elysiera introduces a number of changes to many items, and spells.

## Item Changes
- All arrows deal 5x5 AOE damage.
- - Basic arrows are infinite
- Bolts remain single target
- - Basic bolts are infinite
- Wands and Rods now have their own attack values, scale with Magic Level and Chain to multiple enemies (4 base)
- All spears and throwing weapons chain to up to 5 enemes.
- Spectral Bolts and Diamond Arrows no longer have a timer.

**Runes revamped**
- Fireball now chains to up to 5 targets. Deals 10% less damage than Sudden Death.
- Stalagmite now chains to up to 5 targets. Deals 10% less damage than Sudden Death.
- Icicle now chains to up to 5 targets. Deals 10% less damage than Sudden Death.
- Heavy Magic Missile now chains to up to 5 targets. Deals 10% less damage than Sudden Death.
- ***Developer notes:** We wanted to give outdated runes a situational use. The Sudden Death rune has been the goto rune for single target. Certain monster resistances or vulnerabilities will give the player the option to optimize damage with elemental runes.*

## Paladin skill changes
**Divine Dazzle:**

-   Chain effect on up to 5 creatures (base)
-   Works on melee creatures (if they can run on low health)
-   Prevents creatures from running on low health
-   Skips already affected creatures

**Sharpshooter**
- Now grants 1 charge instead of boosting damage. Charge will allow you to change the effect of one of the following skills:
- *Ethereal Spear*: Fires 5 times for -25% damage per shot.
- *Strong Ethereal Spear*: Deals +25% damage and changes its element to the targets lowest element
- *Divine Missile*: +25% damage.
- *Divine Caldera*: Casts twice. Second cast costs no mana.

*Rank 2 of Augmented Sharpshooter Wheel of Destiny convication gives 2 charges instead of 1*

**Protect Party:**

-   Decreases party members damage take by 1%

**Divine Missile**

-   Chain effect on up to 5 creatures
-   ***Developer notes:** Divine Missile and Ethereal Spear are nearly identical. We wanted to define a situational usage for one spell over the other.*

**New spell: Conjure Royal Star**
- Creates 30 Royal Stars for 1,000 mana
- Requires level 150

**New spell: Conjure Spectral Bolts**
- Creates 100 Spectral Bolts for 1,000 mana
- Requires level 150

**New spell: Conjure Diamond Arrows**
- Creates 100 Diamond Arrows for 1,000 mana

## Knight skill changes
**Chivalrous Challenge:**

-   Chain effect on up to 6 creatures (base)
-   Skips already affected creatures

**Challenge:**

-   Changes ranged creatures to melee (except for bosses)

**Train Party:**

-   Increases party skills by 2% (primary skill; i.e. magic for mages, distance for paladins, does not affect other knights) (does not stack with other knights)

## Mage skill changes

**Magic Shield revamped**
Magic Shield (utamo vita) now completely absorbs 40% of all damage taken. It costs no mana upon taking damage.
utamo vita gives you a shield of 300 + 7.6 x level + 7 x magic-level. The mana cost to cast the spell is 50% of the amount of shield it provides.
Example: If you're level 500 with magic level 100 you'll get 4800 magic shield points (purple bar). Casting utamo vita will cost 2400 mana.
When you take damage, 40% will go to that shield instead, the other 60% will go to your health
Magic shield nodes on wheel of destiny also affect this shield
