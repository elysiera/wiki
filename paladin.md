## üèπ Paladin

The Paladin vocation in the Elysiera game has undergone comprehensive updates, detailed on this page. These changes include modifications to spells and runes, impacting the Paladin's abilities in distinct ways. For example, Divine Caldera now deals a specific amount of damage, while Divine Missile's damage and target count are set to new fixed values. The introduction of the new rune, Divine Rain, an Area of Effect rune, enhances gameplay, especially for Paladins, with its unique damage output.

Additionally, the role of Dexterity has been redefined to influence basic attack speed and dodge chance. The new Focus mechanic introduces a maximum cap of 1000 focus points, which directly affect the auto-attack delay and are influenced by various combat scenarios.

Significant alterations have been made to ammunition, including specific effects and damage changes for arrows, bolts, and throwables. These adjustments are aimed at differentiating the Paladin class, enriching strategic depth in both group and solo play, and preserving the Paladin's core gameplay experience. Players now have the opportunity to engage with an enriched Paladin role, incorporating the Focus gameplay style

### üåü Spell & Rune Adjustments
We're shifting some of the damage around in the paladin toolkit to provide space for Focus to take a role within the damage output.

  - Base damage reduced by 15% 
  - Sharpshooter enhancement damage reduced
- **Divine Missile**
  - Base damage increased by 100%

  - Sharpshooter enhancement targets increased to 10
  - Cooldown is now 4 seconds
- **Holy Missile**
  - Chain rune (5 targets) slightly weaker than Divine Missile

 - Area of effect increased
- **Divine Grenade**
 - Area of effect increased
 - Damage increased _substantially_
 - Cooldown changed (30s/26s/20s)

### ‚ö° Dexterity Changes
- In addition to increasing dodge chance, dexterity will also increase basic attack speed for all vocations. 
  - Each dexterity level decreases auto-attack delay by 1.5ms (up to a minimum total reduction of 33%)
  - This bonus stacks with sword speed increases

### üéØ Focus
- Maximum of 1000 focus 
- At 1000 focus, paladin auto-attack delay is 1.2 seconds (current baseline is 2.0 seconds)
- Focus is generated at the rate of 100 focus per second in combat when attacking 
- Being struck with a melee attack will result in losing 400 focus
- You can only lose focus once every 1.5 seconds
- Focus is represented by the purple bar used for magic shield and phalanx
- Focus loss is reduced by 33% while wearing a shield

### üèπ Ammunition Changes
- **Arrows**
  - Area of effect slightly increased
- **Bolts**
  - Damage per shot by 40%
  - Note that attack speed at full focus doubles attack rate, which offsets this reduction
- **Throwables** (spears/stars/etc)
  - Damage increased by 15%

### üèÅ Goals
- **Distance Skill Role**
  - Distributes paladin AoE damage between magic level and distance fighting
- **Rewarding Mechanic**
  - Focus adds a dynamic layer, offering strategic depth to gameplay in group and solo play
- **Role Definition**
  - Current paladin and knight play very similarly, this change looks to make definition between gameplay styles 
  - While fulfilling a tank role in a party (main or offtank), damage output will be slightly lower
  - While providing a pure dps role to party, damage potential rises
  - Spells reworked to fit tank/dps roles in an intuitive way
- **Maintain Current Gameplay Options**
  - Similar to the Knight rework, we want to maintain the feel of the paladin class
  - Using a **Focus** gameplay style is completely optional
