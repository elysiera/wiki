## "Events"

Yes, we have some quotes around it. Our double experience and skill "event" is actually a weekly voucher. On Wednesday's server save (5PM Pacific) you'll get up to 12h of double skill. On Thursday's server save you get up to 4h of double experience. They don't stack, so make sure you use yours before the week is over!

These can be activated and paused at any time, and they will automatically pause if you logout.
