# Kill Tasks

Kill tasks are timed trials, you have 30 minutes to kill as many of a certain creature as you can. There are a few task tiers:

| Tier | Hunter Tokens | Gold | Experience |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A | 20 | 300k | 50% of a level (maximum level 1000) |
| B | 15 | 200k | 50% of a level (maximum level 500) |
| C | 10 | 100k | 50% of a level (maxiumum level 250) |
| D | 10 | 50k | 50% of a level (maximum level 100) |

In order to complete each task, you need to achieve one of the 4 ranks: **commoner, journeyman, epic, legendary**. Most tasks follow the same patterns, respectively:

- A-Tier: 500, 650, 800, 1000 kills
- B-Tier: 250, 300, 350, 500 kills
- C-Tier: 200, 250, 300, 400 kills
- D-Tier: 150, 200, 250, 350 kills

And in turn, each rank will give you a boosted gold and experience reward:

- **Commoner**: Experience 1✕, Gold: 1✕
- **Journeyman**: Experience 1.2✕, Gold: 1.1✕
- **Epic**: Experience 1.4✕, Gold: 1.2✕
- **Legendary**: Experience 1.6✕, Gold: 1.3✕

## Party

When hunting in a party, the requirements change a bit. The formula is `requiredKills * partySize * 0.8`. So for example:

**2 people, C-tier, commoner**: 200 * 2 * 0.8 = 320
**4 people, A-tier, legendary**: 1000 * 4 * 0.8 = 3200
