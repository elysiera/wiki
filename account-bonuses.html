<p>You'll now receive bonuses for the highest level of each vocation on your account, and you'll also be able <strong>to login to multiple characters at once</strong>. Note, though, that only one character can be outside of a protection zone at a time, this is only meant to allow you to train multiple characters. The initial bonuses are as follows; this feature is currently experimental and we'll adjust these numbers in the coming days:</p>
<ul>
  <li>highest level char: 0.06 speed per level</li>
  <li>highest level knight: +0.005% mitigation per level</li>
  <li>highest level paladin: +0.075 dexterity levels per level</li>
  <li>highest level sorcerer: +0.0025% critical hit chance per level</li>
  <li>highest level druid: +0.005% healing per level</li>
  <li>highest level rookstayer: +0.3 capacity per level</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll stop accruing bonuses at level 1500.&nbsp;</p>
